Hey there! this is a very basic demo of a customer registration system which demonstrates the CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities.

The system has 2 tables (Customer & Gender).

In order to test the system, please download WAMP or XAMPP (local Server) and run the installation ... after that, copy the folder(customerreg) into wwww folder for WAMP & htdocs for XAMPP ..

Please create a new database in phpmyadmin, then import the database that i have included (ongeza_test.sql) which will then populate the tables mentioned above ...

If you have done everything in an order manner, you can then test the system in the browser ... Enyoy ..

Cheers!!!!!!!!
